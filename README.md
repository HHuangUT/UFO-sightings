# UFO-sightings
## Overview of Project
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
## Results
The webpage has been built to filter up to 5 variables:

- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

This is done by using any combination of the entry boxes on the left, to sort the table on the right (shown below).

*Note: Current data set uses acronyms to sort both Country and State*

### Usage
Enter text in the designated field to filter by. Examples of what to enter are provided in grey. 
For example, the table is sorted for all Texas data by entering "tx" in the state field (shown below).

## Summary
### Drawback(s)
This webpage does not have a reference for the acronyms used to denote certain states and countries.

This webpage could greatly benefit from having a "contains" or "not" feature in the filter tool.

### Further Development Effort(s)
#### Map API
Although there may be limitations due to the data, it would be very effect (and interactive) to include a map that could reflect a heatmap of the data represented by the table (Example: Google Maps API). 

#### Sorting Descriptions
In order to see patterns in descriptions, it would be helpful to include features that allow you to filter via terms found in the description.

#### Visual Improvements
Improving the overall visual aesthetic of the webpage would encourage more users to use it and make the overall experience much greater.
